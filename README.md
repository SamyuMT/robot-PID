# Differential Robot Control Project

This repository contains code and resources for a differential robot control system. The project is focused on enabling a robot to move and navigate spatially using motor control, encoder feedback, and various algorithms.

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  Develop and test a control system for a differential drive robot, allowing precise movement, position tracking, and speed regulation.

- **Features:**  
  - Quadrature encoder reading for position and speed feedback  
  - Motor control via PWM signals  
  - Serial communication for remote commands  
  - Calculation of position (degrees), speed (RPM), and angular velocity (rad/s)  
  - Modular code for easy adaptation and extension

## Structure

- **Pruebas (Tests):**  
  Experimental code and hardware tests for encoders, motors, and communication.

- **Desarrollo (Development):**  
  Main control algorithms, integration of sensors, and robot logic.

- **App / Aplicaciones (Applications):**  
  Example applications, user interfaces, and integration with external systems.

- **Usos (Use Cases):**  
  Demonstrations of robot movement, navigation, and control in different environments.

## Status

The project is under active development. Code and hardware setups are being tested and improved. Contributions and feedback are welcome.

## Applications

- Educational robotics
- Autonomous navigation
- Mobile robot research
- Remote control and monitoring
